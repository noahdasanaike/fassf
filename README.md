[note: currently not in package form, very early work in progress]

An R package with various improved and original functions for spatial analysis in R, as well as a repository for basic spatial data. Mostly wrappers that improve/add functionality.

Current functionality:
- faster averages from spatial intersections
- faster st filter
- faster match each x with a y polygon
- faster st distance
- add latitude and longitude columns
- ruggedness calculations (median absolute deviation)
- small area nightlight estimates
- generate voronoi polygons for coordinates bounded by a polygon
- geocode query with geocode.xyz and openstreetmap
- query openstreetmap, get polygons
- drive time calculation between points with openstreetmap
- obtain values from raster for polygons
- split polygon by line
- rotate polygon
